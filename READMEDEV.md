# Redex Camping: Developer Rules

Hi Redex Camping: Restart Developer, we appreciate that you've decided to contribute to the game's development. Here are some basic rules you should follow:

# 1. Respect the privacy of all players involved in the game and do not share any private information without consent. (mostly the most enforced rule)
# 2. Ensure that all content in the game, including models and scripts, is appropriate and follows the Roblox terms of service. (obviously)
# 3. Communicate clearly and effectively with other developers and players to ensure that everyone understands the goals and objectives of the game. (helps a lot)
# 4. Provide clear instructions and guidelines for any tools or features available in the game to prevent misuse or confusion. (helps a lot)
# 5. Always test new updates or changes in a separate environment to minimize the risk of disrupting gameplay or causing errors. (not required but recommended)
